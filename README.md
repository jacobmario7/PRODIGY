# Prodigy Intership Project Repository
## Welcome to the Prodigy Internship Project Repository!


## Project Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for three exciting machine learning projects developed during my internship at Prodigy. These projects encompass data science domain, their uses and practical applications of predicting techniques.

## Project Highlights
### 1.Visualizing Data Distribution
Created bar charts and histograms to visualize age and gender distributions.
Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear and informative visualizations.
### 2. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Cleaned and analyzed the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Explored survival rates based on various factors like gender, class, and age.
### 3. Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
Built a decision tree classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset.
Achieved high accuracy in predicting customer purchases.
### 4. Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data
Analyzed sentiment patterns in social media data using NLP techniques.
Visualized sentiment trends to understand public opinion on specific topics or brands.
